# AI-Based Disaster Relief Robot Coordinator (ADR-C)
This project is a simulation of robots navigating through a grid with obstacles to reach a goal.

## Features:
- Robots use pathfinding (A* Algorithm) to avoid obstacles.
- Dynamic obstacle repositioning during the simulation.
- Real-time visualization with Matplotlib.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- numpy
- matplotlib

## How to Run:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the main simulation with `python robot_simulation.py`.
